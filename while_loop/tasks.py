# Task 1
# Create a number guessing game where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess it.
# The script should use a while loop to repeatedly prompt the user for their guess and provide feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
# The loop should terminate when the user correctly guesses the number.


# Task 2 - Countdown Timer
# Create a countdown timer that asks the user to input a number of seconds.
# The script should then use a while loop to count down from the given number to zero, printing the remaining time each second.
# Once the countdown reaches zero, it should print a message indicating that the time is up.


# Task 3 Sum of Positive Numbers
# Write a Python script that continuously prompts the user to enter numbers.
# The script should add these numbers to a running total but should stop and print the total sum when the user enters a negative number.
# The negative number should not be included in the sum.
